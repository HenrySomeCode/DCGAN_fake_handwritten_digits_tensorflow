# DCGAN: Generating Fake Handwritten Digits using Tensorflow

Hi, this aims to generate fake handwritten digits using the Mnist dataset and TensorFlow.

This is my reference:  https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan 

What makes this different from the reference? I added many comments to explain the model deeply and express my opinions as well. This is something that the tutorial doesn't tell!

Note: the "#???" in Colab is for researching later on if I have time or could be considered a potential point to change to improve the model.
